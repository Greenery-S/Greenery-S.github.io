      <description>Argo Workflow (1) A lot of examples can be found here: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/tree/main/examples However, since the docker/whalesay image is no longer supported, many examples cannot run, and you need to build an image to replace it.&#xA;1 Argo CLI argo submit hello-world.yaml # submit a workflow spec to Kubernetes argo list # list current workflows argo get hello-world-xxx # get info about a specific workflow argo logs hello-world-xxx # print the logs from a workflow argo delete hello-world-xxx # delete workflow You can also use kubectl, but you need to specify the namespace.</description>

      <description>A Somewhat Rocky &amp;ldquo;Quick&amp;rdquo; Start Recently, I wanted to review Argo Workflow, so I decided to start from the official documentation and follow the steps one by one. However, things didn&amp;rsquo;t go as smoothly as expected. The official docker/whalesay image is no longer supported in the latest Docker version, which has caused hundreds of hello world examples based on it to fail to run properly. So, I decided to build my own image to replace the official docker/whalesay image.</description>
