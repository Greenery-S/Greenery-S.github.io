It allows you to maintain your blog using Git, making it particularly suitable for programmers, as most of us are familiar with Git.&#xA;Hugo is a great static site generator that lets you create static websites using Markdown files. This method is ideal for programmers since most of us are comfortable with Markdown.</description>

      <description>Article Classification System The classification of articles is managed by two fields: tags and categories. Tags are used for more casual classifications, such as golang and gopher, while categories are used for more formal topic classifications, such as go-dual-token-blog-system.&#xA;The URLs for the lists of tags and categories are /tags/ and /categories/, respectively. These URLs are set in the navigation bar, making it easy to view all tags and categories.</description>
